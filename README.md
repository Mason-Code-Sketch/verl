# Black-Box On-Policy Distillation of Large Language Models

This repository contains the algorithm implementation for our paper **"Black-Box On-Policy Distillation of Large Language Models"**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

We use two repos as to easily install different branches for different experiments. Check [GAD Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/gad) for environment setup and scripts for running experiments. Check this repo for algorithm implementation. 

We implement based on [VeRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl). **We hack to use the `critic` module in VeRL as our discriminator**.

There are four branches in this repo: `seqkd` branch for running the SeqKD baseline, `warmup` branch for warmup stage of our method, `gad` branch for GAD training stage of our method and `eval` branch to use the already-trained model to perform generation only.

For SeqKD and warmup stage of GAD, the student is supervised-finetuned on the teacher response (corresponding code at [sft_seqkd](https://github.com/YTianZHU/verl/blob/seqkd/verl/workers/actor/dp_actor.py#L485) and [sft_warmup](https://github.com/YTianZHU/verl/blob/warmup/verl/workers/actor/dp_actor.py#L495)). We choose to use this VeRL-based repo to implement them for best alignment.
